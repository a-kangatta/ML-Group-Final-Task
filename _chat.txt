I have added 2 items to the description of this group.
One is a link to a Google Docs file containing the credentials for the class zoom meetings. I hope to have added links for all the classes by the end of next week.
The second one is a link to a Google Docs file that contains LMS platform details, either e-learning or Google Classroom. I will update this document as and when I get the credentials. It currently has the credentials for IS Project II, Social Informatics and ISSD

1. Bundles should be sent to us by the 28th of May; latest 31st May
2. The University is planning for phased resumption of physical learning. We as 4th years will be the first to resume physical learning. This will be from 7th June 2021.
If you have any questions, concerns, comments or suggestions on the phased resumption, please send them to me via PC. I will consolidate a document with everything and get it to the administration.
3. For the SBL marks, as was mentioned a while back, the marks are in the system, they just need to be published by the Exams office. The SCES administration will follow up on this with the exams office.
4. The registration for ISSD will be availed on AMS during the course of this week.

[10/06/2021, 12:40:19] Allen (Class): I am not entirely sure about this

He would like us to think of a basic system model to represent a real world scenario with your environment
[10/06/2021, 13:26:49] ‪+254 740 623000‬: In a nutshell, sims&model is more like a scientific approach to real world scenario. Ignore logic, you need problem statements (hypothesis), and the experiment as is. 
So in this example of modeling a real world system: 
- hypothesis is the purpose of the modeling
- entity is the class, or in this case the actors in that environment you’re trying to model
- attribute is what the entity does 
- behavior is what are the possible observations
[10/06/2021, 13:27:35] ‪+254 740 623000‬: Think of the model as if it’s an ML algorithm
[10/06/2021, 15:39:55] Allen (Class): Good Afternoon People!

Professor Ateya has uploaded all relevant content for Distributed Systems apart from the open book CAT

[13/06/2021, 08:39:46] ‪+254 734 818603‬: Let's not forget about the possibility of getting a free class if we decide on when to have the compiler CAT before tomorrow.


😄
[13/06/2021, 08:44:58] ‪+254 706 907703‬: Say it in main group maybe, we have to look for a common free time both ICS A & B for the CAT

I hope you are all doing well!

First, the lecturer for ISSD is running slightly late, and as a result, class will begin at 8:45am. In the meantime, he has requested us to go through class discuss that he uploaded on Google Classroom today morning

Secondly, the lecturer for Embedded Systems and IoT is a bit under the weather, and as result, he has cancelled today's class

[15/06/2021, 08:36:58] Allen (Class): There is something else that needs to be decided on

Since we have been split into sub-groups, I think it would be prudent to have a class rep in both sub-groups to help with coordination and communication

I am in A2
So, we need a class rep in A1?
Any volunteers?🤔

[20/06/2021, 13:03:18] Allen (Class): Good Morning People

For the CAT dates, some things are not clear... For example, whether we are doing them online or in school, and whether we are going to have them scheduled in a CAT timetable

What I am sure of as of now is that Mr. Ruiru said that we would have CAT 1 for compiler construction tomorrow during the online lesson. We will write our answers down and then scan and upload on e-learning
For machine learning, he said that he was waiting for the administrator to give him a date and venue when both 4A and 4B can do the exam on campus. I have not received further communication on this.
For social Informatics, he wasn't too clear about the CAT. I will get in touch with him and get more information on it.

[21/06/2021, 14:40:29] ‪+254 740 623000‬: I thought VC is a virtual class

[21/06/2021, 21:37:24] ‪+254 740 623000‬: From my analysis (lol), the show its a mixture of TD and SCOT. TD in that the tech is actually influencing guys like we can see snapchat filter lookalikes, depression and all those shenanigans and yunno without your conscious being awareness. SCOT from a perspective that the designers and engineers are targeting specific people using the algorithms they write, but remember the algorithms are evolving

For distributed systems:
The date in the doc is the beginning for when the assignment can accept submissions and the date on e-learning is the due date. Then, from the due date, you have a one week extension...so tomorrow's date is the due date and you'll have a 1 week extension which is 31st :)

[24/06/2021, 17:03:51] ‪+254 790 271611‬: Lmao😂 Allen the saviour 🙏🏽😂
[24/06/2021, 17:09:52] Allen (Class): So
People

1. I have just gotten a clarification from the lecturer about the assignment due dates. So the date inside each tutorial exercise document is the actual due date. The date on e-learning is the final acceptance date for submissions for that assignment. There was a miscommunication between the lecturer and I Monday. Apologies for that one guys. Because of this miscommunication, the lecturer has given us upto Saturday 26th @ 5:15pm to submit tutorial exercise 1. All other subsequent tutorial exercises will have their deadlines as per the date on e-learning
[24/06/2021, 17:13:08] Allen (Class): Secondly
For this one hour class where we are supposed to be doing group discussions, the lecturer cannot just give us the hour free because of accountability with the school
Therefore, this is his proposal
For the 1 hour virtual class, we only login for 30 minutes and do the discussions for those 30 minutes. After that we are free to leave
[24/06/2021, 17:17:52] Allen (Class): Lastly, for futures purposes, if you guys feel that there is something you would like me to address with a lecturer for a particular unit, kindly inform me and I will do my best to try and address the concern.
I would appreciate not being put in an uncomfortable situation like today's again.
Thank you.

[25/06/2021, 15:12:27] ‪+254 740 623000‬: Generaliziom error is too high (so he overfitted the data). Thsi occurs because training data is small so model learns all there is to learn about that small set
[25/06/2021, 15:13:38] ‪+254 740 623000‬: So they need to train with whole horses not half a horse

And if you do, please propose an alternative date
[12/08/2021, 09:41:29] Dalton: Morning Allen 
Question...
Why is it not possible tomorrow?
[12/08/2021, 09:42:23] Allen (Class): The initial request to move it was because of  Sports Day
[12/08/2021, 09:42:55] Dalton: Sports Day has been postponed

27th is a bit too far😅

Idk if anyone shares the same thoughts really
